Hello and welcome to Albert Sucks, the one and only blog dedicated to
NYU's terrible terrible web design. The point of this blog is to
dissect precisely how and why NYU's web design sucks. You see, I am a
developer. I've done my fair share of web development, specifically
React/Redux with ES6+ if you're into buzzwords. And having peeked
behind the curtain that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I can tell you
that NYU's websites are worse than you think, are worse than you can
imagine.

NYU's websites are clusterfucks of bad design, baffling, unusable
interfaces, and just plain ugly aesthetics. They are written using
technologies that predate Facebook, Twitter--hell they're coming close
to predating some NYU students. They are utterly confusing and
essentially hostile towards the end user. They, in short, are *shit*.

And yet every student puts up with these horrible experiences. The
goal of this blog is to change that. I want to expose precisely why
you feel so uncomfortable trying to find your grades, why you hate
registering for courses, why these sites just feel so **bad**. If I
can get one student to stand up and say "I demand better from NYU",
then I will have achieved my goal.

This blog is built using Hugo, a static site generator. I'm using the
[Bootstrap v4
Blog](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/)
theme. It's hosted in AWS using S3, Cloudfront and Route 53. The
domain was bought using Gandi.
