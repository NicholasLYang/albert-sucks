This blog is dedicated to how much NYU's web design sucks. Basically,
as a front end developer (React/Redux with ES6+ if you're hiring), I
understand precisely the extent to which NYU's websites are fucked up
(*hint* *hint*, a lot). The goal of this blog is to expose precisely
how and why NYU's design sucks.

The blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site
generator, and the [Hugo Bootstrap v4 Blog
theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/). It is
hosted on AWS using S3, Cloudfront and Route 53.
