  <p>Hello and welcome to Albert Sucks, the one and only blog dedicated to
NYU&rsquo;s terrible terrible web design. The point of this blog is to
dissect precisely how and why NYU&rsquo;s web design sucks. You see, I am a
developer. I&rsquo;ve done my fair share of web development, specifically
React/Redux with ES6+ if you&rsquo;re into buzzwords. And having peeked
behind the curtain that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I can tell you
that NYU&rsquo;s websites are worse than you think, are worse than you can
imagine.</p>

<p>NYU&rsquo;s websites are clusterfucks of bad design, baffling, unusable
interfaces, and just plain ugly aesthetics. They are written using
technologies that predate Facebook, Twitter&ndash;hell they&rsquo;re coming close
to predating some NYU students. They are utterly confusing and
essentially hostile towards the end user. They, in short, are <em>shit</em>.</p>

<p>And yet every student puts up with these horrible experiences. The
goal of this blog is to change that. I want to expose precisely why
you feel so uncomfortable trying to find your grades, why you hate
registering for courses, why these sites just feel so <strong>bad</strong>. If I
can get one student to stand up and say &ldquo;I demand better from NYU&rdquo;,
then I will have achieved my goal.</p>

<p>This blog is built using Hugo, a static site generator. I&rsquo;m using the
<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/">Bootstrap v4
Blog</a>
theme. It&rsquo;s hosted in AWS using S3, Cloudfront and Route 53. The
domain was bought using Gandi.</p>
