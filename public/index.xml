      <description>This blog is dedicated to how much NYU&amp;rsquo;s web design sucks. Basically, as a front end developer (React/Redux with ES6+ if you&amp;rsquo;re hiring), I understand precisely the extent to which NYU&amp;rsquo;s websites are fucked up (hint hint, a lot). The goal of this blog is to expose precisely how and why NYU&amp;rsquo;s design sucks.
The blog is built with Hugo, a static site generator, and the Hugo Bootstrap v4 Blog theme.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to Albert Sucks, the one and only blog dedicated to NYU&amp;rsquo;s terrible terrible web design. The point of this blog is to dissect precisely how and why NYU&amp;rsquo;s web design sucks. You see, I am a developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve done my fair share of web development, specifically React/Redux with ES6+ if you&amp;rsquo;re into buzzwords. And having peeked behind the curtain that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I can tell you that NYU&amp;rsquo;s websites are worse than you think, are worse than you can imagine.</description>
